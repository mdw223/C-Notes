  // to an array like palette.

  // room for as many colors as we need.

  // There are some goofy things going on above.  Notice, I'm using
  // the dereference operator to figure out how much memory I need for
  // a single color of the palette.  Since pal is undefined, this would be
  // a bad idea, but it's fine inside sizeof, it doesn't evaluate sizeof,
  // it just computes the size it would have if I did dereference it.

  // Also, notice in the type cast above, I have something that looks like a
  // variable declaration, with the variable name omitted.  That's
  // what you'd normally expect; a type looks like a variable
  // declaration without the variable name.  Here, though, that makes
  // the parentheses around the star look like they aren't doing
  // anything, since they don't have a variable name to group the star
  // with.  However, they are still needed and they're doing the same
  // job, they are saying this type is a pointer to an array, not an
  // array of pointers.

  // OK, now we have an array with room for 1000 colors, lets fill it with some
  // random ones.  See, it works just like a 2D array we allocated on the
  // stack or statically.

  // C99 supports variable-sized arrays, and this also applies to
  // pointers to variable-sized arrays.  Here, we're dynamically
  // allocating an array of R rows and C columns.  Notice that the
  // type of the pointer for this array is "pointer to a C-element
  // array of ints.

  // Often, we want to represent a 2D array as an array of pointers,
  // one for each row.  This is a more flexible representation, since
  // we can add rows by growing the outer array, or independently
  // lengthen any row by allocating a longer array for it.  It's a
  // little more work to build a structure like this using malloc, but
  // the added flexibility may be worth it.

  // Here, we're building a R X C table like a above, but implemented
  // as an array of row pointers.  I need an array of R pointers to
  // int.  I'll hold this array with a pointer to its first element (a
  // pointer to int), so the type will need to be pointer to pointer
  // to int.
  int **b;

  // Now, we need to allocate space for each row.

  // Just like in the previous example, write some stuff into the array.
  for ( int i = 0; i < R; i++ )
    for ( int j = 0; j < C; j++ )
      b[ i ][ j ] = i * j;

  // Now, let's free the memory for each structure.  First the pallete.  It's
  // one big block of memory, so it's easy to free.
  free( pal );

  // The R X C two dimensional array is also one big block, so we just
  // need one call to free.
  free( a );

  // For the array of row pointers, first we need to free the memory
  // for each row.  Then, we free the memory for the outer array, the
  // one containing pointers to each row.
